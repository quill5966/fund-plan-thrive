  "transcribedText": "So, in the next year, I have two main goals. One is I want to buy a house. And the second one is I want to find a new job with a higher base pay. So for my house, I am targeting the 700 to 800,000 range, just because that allows me to find a house that's essentially move-in ready in this Denver area. I do need to still figure out the specific neighborhoods. And my current rent is about $2,500 a month, so I would like to start building equity. And so I'm hoping to close by the middle of next year or to the fall time frame. And then my second goal, I do want to find a new job with a higher base pay of at least $200,000. I'm a product manager in the tech industry, so I'm looking to stay within that career path. But I'm largely concerned about the tough job market, since there are a lot of qualified candidates who were recently laid off by big tech companies. So I think the competition is very tough right now, but I'm looking for remote, but I'm also open to hybrid. I'm based in the Broomfield, Colorado area, so I feel like if I look for hybrid, I might have a better chance of landing a job."
