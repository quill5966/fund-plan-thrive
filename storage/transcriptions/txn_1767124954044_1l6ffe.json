  "transcribedText": "In 2026, I want to find a new job with higher pay, with a base of $200,000. I am a product manager in the tech industry, but I'm concerned about the tough job market right now, since there were layoffs by the Fane Company, so there's a lot of well-qualified product managers out there. I'm looking for a remote or hybrid job, and I'm based in Broomfield, Colorado. My previous company was in the data software analytics industry or domain, but I'm not tied to that, so I could definitely change to a different domain, but I think I want to continue down the product manager career path, just to be able to keep moving upwards and increasing my base pay."
