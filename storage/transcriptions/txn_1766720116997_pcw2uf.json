  "transcribedText": "Hi, alright so let me go through what I have in my retirement funds as well as debts that I have. So right now I have a checking account, I essentially consider it to be a rainy day fund and there's about $70,000 in there right now. And then I do have a 401k with Fidelity that I've gotten over through work. I try to contribute about $6,000 to it every year and I'm kind of middle of my career right now so as of the end of last year I had $500,000 and then now I have about $580,000 from my contribution and then just growth in the investments themselves. And then for the debt that I have, so I am still paying off student loans. Last year I had $12,000 in student loans and then now I have about $10,000 remaining. Mortgage, house mortgage, so recently bought a house, the mortgage was $700,000 and now I have $675,000 remaining to pay off of it. And for the mortgage I pay about $60,000 per year on it. So essentially the principal that I've paid off has been $25,000 over this year. And then car loan, I had $6,000 on it and then as of now the remaining balance is $5,000. So that's my existing debt right now. I don't hold a credit card balance so I wouldn't consider that to be an ongoing debt that I have to try to pay off. I kind of just think about it as my monthly living expenses."
