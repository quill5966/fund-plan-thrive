  "transcribedText": "In the next year, I want to buy a house. I'm targeting in the $700,000 to $800,000 range since that looks like pretty reasonable for properties where it would be nice, but still good enough as almost a starter home, but move-in ready. I still need to figure out the neighborhood though, but I want to go ahead and start building equity since our current rent is $2,500 a month, which is pretty steep. I know that the monthly payment will be more, but at least I can start building equity in the property."
