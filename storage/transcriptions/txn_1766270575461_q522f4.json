  "transcribedText": "Hi, I'm looking forward to talking with you. So right now I have about $100,000 in my check-in account. Actually that was as of October 2024, last I checked I had $100,000. I'm checking now and right now I have $120,000 because I got a bonus from work and I only have a car loan. I still have $36,500 left to pay on it and right now I rent so I don't have a mortgage and I don't hold a credit card balance. I pay it off every month. My credit card is typically $1,000 to $3,000 every month that I pay off."
